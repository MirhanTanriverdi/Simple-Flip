# Coin Flip Application

This is a simple React Native application that simulates a coin flip, allowing users to tap a button to 'flip' a virtual coin and see the result displayed on the screen. The app also tracks the number of flips and allows users to reset this count.

## Features

- **Flip Simulation**: Tap the button to simulate a coin flip, displaying either "Star" or "Guard".
- **Flip Counter**: Keeps track of the number of flips made during the session.
- **Reset Counter**: Allows users to reset the flip counter back to zero.
